This code was used in my thesis and was designed to run on the University of Kent's HPC system.
Chapter 3 shows the code for looking at junction-spanning reads linking specific exons to look at splicing patterns. 
Chapter 4 used RNA-seq and differentially gene expression pipelines to look at transcriptomic changes.
